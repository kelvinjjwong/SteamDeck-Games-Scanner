SteamDeck Games Scanner

I archive SD games to a shared folder after downloaded and installed to save traffic fee.
would like to write a tiny tool to compare both sides.

### objectives:

- load installed game folders from both internal disk and micro SD card
- load archived file list from a network shared folder
- compare the 2 list above

### dependency
- PyQt5
- BreezeStyleSheets
